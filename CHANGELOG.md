## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Architecture Refactoring)

- **Hub-and-Spoke Pipeline**: The `BlockSampler` is now the central hub that creates the `GenerationContext` (`UME_PIPELINE`). Loaders and settings nodes feed into it as side-inputs.
- **Loaders → `UME_BUNDLE`**: All 6 loader nodes (Checkpoint, FLUX, Fragmented, ZIMG, Advanced, BundleLoader) now return a single `UME_BUNDLE` dict `{model, clip, vae, model_name}` instead of three separate outputs.
- **`GenerationSettings` → `UME_SETTINGS`**: Returns a settings dict instead of requiring a pipeline input. No longer creates a `GenerationContext`.
- **`BlockSampler`**: Accepts `model_bundle` (UME_BUNDLE) + `settings` (UME_SETTINGS) as inputs, creates `GenerationContext` internally, stores sampled image within it, returns `UME_PIPELINE`.
- **Post-process nodes → pipeline-only**: All 8 post-processing nodes (UltimateUpscale Simple/Advanced, SeedVR2 Simple/Advanced, FaceDetailer Simple/Advanced, Detail Daemon Simple/Advanced) now read the image from `pipeline.image` and return `UME_PIPELINE` with the updated image. No more separate image input/output.
- **`ImageSaver` → pipeline-only**: Reads image from `pipeline.image` instead of a separate `images` input.
- **`BlockImageProcess`**: Removed `pipeline` input dependency. Added `auto_resize` flag that is stored in the `UME_IMAGE` bundle and acted upon by the `BlockSampler` using generation settings dimensions.
- **Display names**: Loader outputs renamed to `model_bundle`, sampler/post-process outputs renamed to `generation`.
- **`GenerationContext`**: Added `image` field, renamed `sampler` → `sampler_name`, `positive` → `positive_prompt`, `negative` → `negative_prompt`.

### Added

- Custom connection colors for `UME_BUNDLE` (#3498DB, bright blue) and `UME_PIPELINE` (#1ABC9C, teal) in `web/umeairt_colors.js`.
- **New node: `Unpack Pipeline`** — Decomposes a `UME_PIPELINE` into 15 native ComfyUI outputs (IMAGE, MODEL, CLIP, VAE, prompts, settings, denoise) for full interoperability with native and community nodes.
- Updated `Unpack Image Bundle` to output all 5 fields: image, mask, mode, denoise, auto_resize (previously only image and mask).
- **New node: `Pack Models Bundle`** — Packs native MODEL, CLIP, VAE into a `UME_BUNDLE` for use with Block nodes. Enables interoperability from any native or community loader into the UmeAiRT pipeline.

### Fixed

- Fixed critical installation issues by synchronizing `pyproject.toml` dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
- Removed duplicated and outdated class definitions (`UmeAiRT_FilesSettings_FLUX`, `UmeAiRT_FilesSettings_Fragmented`) in `modules/block_nodes.py`.
- Fixed manifest loading bug by correcting `bundles.json` reference to `umeairt_bundles.json` in `modules/utils_nodes.py`.
- Replaced numerous bare `except: pass` statements across the codebase with specific or generic exception handling to improve debuggability and stability.
- Restored missing activation switches (`lora_{i}_on`) in all `UmeAiRT_LoraBlock` nodes to properly toggle LoRAs on or off.
- Fixed `UmeAiRT_FilesSettings_Checkpoint_Advanced` incorrectly returning `UME_PIPELINE` instead of `UME_BUNDLE`, making it incompatible with the `BlockSampler`. Now returns a standard `UME_BUNDLE` dict like all other loaders.
- Fixed `UmeAiRT_Unpack_FilesBundle` accepting obsolete `UME_FILES` type; now accepts `UME_BUNDLE`.
- Fixed `UmeAiRT_Unpack_Settings` reading `sampler` key instead of `sampler_name`, causing it to always return the default `"euler"`.

### Removed

- Removed `UmeAiRT_WirelessKSampler` from `__init__.py` registrations (class was already deleted from `logic_nodes.py`, causing a latent `ImportError` at startup).
- Removed orphaned `UME_SHARED_STATE[KEY_LORAS]` write from `MultiLoraLoader` (Block nodes no longer read from global state).

### Added

- Added automated `tests/test_smoke.py` for validating core module imports and node class mappings.
- Implemented a startup "Health Check" node (or process) to validate dependencies and optimizations.
- Added `tests/test_traversal.py` for path traversal security regression testing.

### Security

- Added defense-in-depth path traversal guard in `ImageSaverLogic.save_images()` (`modules/image_saver_core/logic.py`). The output path is now validated with `os.path.abspath()` + `startswith()` to ensure it stays within the output directory, independently of caller-side sanitization.
