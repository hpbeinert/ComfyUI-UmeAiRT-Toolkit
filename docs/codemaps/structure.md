# Project Structure Map

## High-Level Anatomy

| Directory/File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `__init__.py` | **ENTRY POINT**. Registers nodes with ComfyUI and handles theme/settings injection. |
| `modules/` | **CORE LOGIC**. Refactored modular node implementations. |
| `web/` | Javascript files for UI extensions (styling, colors, and Nodes 2.0 enforcements). |
| `docs/` | Internal architectural documentation and code maps. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Developer guide for AI Agents. |

## Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke Pipeline

The toolkit uses a **hub-and-spoke** architecture centered on the `BlockSampler`:

```
Loader (UME_BUNDLE) ──┐
Settings (UME_SETTINGS)──┤
Prompts ──────────────────┤──▶ BlockSampler ──▶ UME_PIPELINE (GenerationContext)
LoRAs ────────────────────┤                        │
Source Image (UME_IMAGE) ─┘                        ├──▶ Post-Process (Upscale/Detail/Daemon)
                                                   └──▶ ImageSaver
```

- **`UME_BUNDLE`**: dict `{model, clip, vae, model_name}` — produced by Loaders.
- **`UME_SETTINGS`**: dict `{width, height, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, seed}` — produced by GenerationSettings.
- **`UME_PIPELINE`**: `GenerationContext` object — created by BlockSampler, carries image + all context through post-processing chain.

## Interoperability (Pack/Unpack Nodes)

Pack and Unpack nodes enable bidirectional compatibility with native/community ComfyUI nodes:

| Node | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Pack Models Bundle** | Native → UME | Packs MODEL + CLIP + VAE into `UME_BUNDLE` |
| **Unpack Models Bundle** | UME → Native | Extracts MODEL, CLIP, VAE, model_name from `UME_BUNDLE` |
| **Unpack Pipeline** | UME → Native | Extracts IMAGE + all 14 fields from `UME_PIPELINE` |
| **Unpack Settings Bundle** | UME → Native | Extracts all settings from `UME_SETTINGS` |
| **Unpack Image Bundle** | UME → Native | Extracts IMAGE, MASK, mode, denoise, auto_resize from `UME_IMAGE` |
| **Unpack Prompts Bundle** | UME → Native | Extracts positive/negative strings from `UME_PROMPTS` |

## Sub-Modules (`modules/`)

- `common.py`: `GenerationContext` class, shared constants, and core utilities.
- `logger.py`: Standardized colorized logging utility.
- `optimization_utils.py`: Environment checks (SageAttention, Triton, etc.).
- `settings_nodes.py`: Wireless Variable Setters/Getters (Steps, CFG, Prompts).
- `model_nodes.py`: Wireless and Block-based Model/LoRA loaders.
- `logic_nodes.py`: Pipeline-aware Upscalers, Detailers, and Detail Daemon nodes.
- `block_nodes.py`: Block Loaders (→ `UME_BUNDLE`), GenerationSettings (→ `UME_SETTINGS`), BlockSampler (→ `UME_PIPELINE`), and Block post-processors.
- `image_nodes.py`: Image loading, processing, and saving (pipeline-aware).
- `utils_nodes.py`: Labels, state debuggers, Pack/Unpack nodes.

## Core Directories (Vendored/Integrated)

- `facedetailer_core/`: Logic for face detection and enhancement.
- `seedvr2_core/`: Ported tiling upscaler for high-VRAM efficiency.
- `usdu_core/`: Integrated Ultimate SD Upscale logic.
- `image_saver_core/`: Robust image saving with metadata.
- `vendor/comfyui_gguf/`: GGUF model loading support.
- `vendor/aria2/`: Bundled aria2c binary for accelerated model downloads.

## Registration Workflow

1. Node classes are defined in `modules/`.
2. `__init__.py` imports necessary classes.
3. `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` links ComfyUI internal keys to Python classes.
4. `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` provides user-friendly titles.
5. `WEB_DIRECTORY` exposes the `web/` folder for frontend styling.
